#  Color Mix 🌈🖍️🎨
ColorMix app built in Unit 4 Building Apps of Apple's Swift Explorations course. This has additional label to to show the float values for each color.
We have added additional labels to show the RGB values for each color and a hexadecimal label for the color displayed in the view. These are given as an optional (Swift pun intended 😜) bonus assignment.

## Background 👩🏼‍🎓 🧑🏿‍🎓 👨🏽‍🎓 👩🏻‍💻 👨🏾‍💻
This project is part of Unit 4 in Apple's **Develop in Swift AP CS Principles** ([Teacher](https://books.apple.com/us/book/develop-in-swift-ap-cs-principles-teacher-guide/id1581182833) and [Student](https://books.apple.com/us/book/develop-in-swift-ap-cs-principles/id1581182719)) course and **Develop in Swift Explorations** ([Teacher](https://books.apple.com/us/book/develop-in-swift-explorations-teacher-guide/id1581182814) and [Student](https://books.apple.com/us/book/develop-in-swift-explorations/id1581182728)) course. This app starts on page 301 in the student book. This app gives students much practice connecting storyboard elements to the ViewController Cocoa Touch Class file that controls that storyboard view. Additionally, this app project enables students to learn about the common iOS event actions such as buttons, switches, and sliders.

This is a great first app that students get to build "from scratch" because it uses many of the common iOS app conventions.

## Purpose 🖥 💻 📱
The overall purpose of this project is to teach students how an app is built and the process app developers follow to start, test, improve, and finish an app. The project also gives students plenty of opportunities to practice some common actions in iOS app development such as control-dragging to connect UI elements to Cocoa Touch Class file that controls the View Controller through the use of the Assistant Editor in Xcode. If you are going to do this project individually or with your students, I am going to assume that you have access to Mac hardware, the Books app, Python installed on the Mac, and a Python interpreter.

### Learning Goal
Students will learn how to build user interfaces in the Xcode Interface Builder tools, and tie user interface elements into code via actions and outlets. Students will practice creating outlets to access properties of a user interface view, and actions to respond to user interaction with buttons and other controls as they build a color picker app.

### Ohio CS Standard(s)
1. ATP.CS.9-12.A.a - Write programs that use library methods and control structures and methods to solve a problem.
2. ATP.M.9-12.A.c - Create programming solutions by reusing existing code (e.g., libraries, Application Programming Interface (APIs), code repositories).
3. ATP.A.9-12.F.b - Define and implement an algorithm by decomposing problem requirements from a problem statement to solve a problem.
4. ATP.CS.9-12.F.b - Use appropriate syntax to create and use a method.


## Process 👩🏾‍🏫 👨🏻‍🏫 👨🏻‍💻 👩🏽‍💻
The general process and flow of this project is in the format of an Apple Teacher Portfolio lesson. There are three parts/phases to the lesson
    - Activate
    - Explore 
    - Apply
 You can learn more about and sign up for Apple Teacher here: [Apple Teacher](https://www.apple.com/education/k12/teacher-resources/). 


### Activate
We want our students to activate any prior knowledge on the topic. My students have some experience in Adobe products, but do not have an extensive amount of knowledge on RGB. So, I have them watch this video [RGB Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lL0pxSslCzo).


### Explore
Students will create their own RGB screen representation as shown in the video.

    1. Have students launch Keynote.
    2. Create a Keynote slide that displays the same color information representation when all three colors are displayed on a screen as shown in the video .


### Apply 
In this part of the project we build the app.
    
    1. The instructions and process of building the app starts on page 301 in the student book.
    2. Individual steps and further explanations can be found as comments in the ViewController file in the project.


### Assessment
Students will demonstrate a fully functional app that operates as intended. The demonstration will be done in the iOS Simulator app and recorded using the built-in macOS screen recorder (shift-command-5). Students submit their screen recording and a PDF of their code.
